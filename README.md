# Guess

The logic of this game is to allow users predict the numbers between random numbers

if the users  inputted number equals the result of the random number generated we will return 

a positive statement  printing the number they guessed, else we will tell tham to try it again.

This project was built for my personal blog as a comprehensive method in explaining the differences between
client side and that of server side engineer.

As I am using it for educational purposes I am looking forward to any student or experiance developers
that might have some suggestions that they think I can add to the functionality of this project.
