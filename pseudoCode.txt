The logic of this game is to allow users predict the numbers between random numbers

if the users  inputted number equals the result of the random number we will return 

a positive statement  printing the number they guessed, else we will tell tham to try it again.


pseudo code for the game.



have to check if the user press the button before running the code 

var number = rand(1,100);// variable that will out put the numbers bet 1 - 100

user_input=_POST[user_input];// variable that the user input will be assigned to

we will write the logic that will determine if the number 

enter by the user equalls to the random output by var numbers

Lets start coding

if number entered by users is greater than 100 terminate code with error message;
